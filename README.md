# 🫁 Lung Cancer Detection Model

This project focuses on the development and evaluation of a machine learning-based system to predict the presence of lung cancer. Multiple classification algorithms were explored and compared to identify the most accurate and efficient model for early detection.

## 🧠 Overview

The goal of this project is to assist in the early diagnosis of lung cancer using patient data. Accurate early detection can significantly improve survival rates and aid medical professionals in decision-making.

## 🛠️ Algorithms Used

The following machine learning algorithms were implemented and tested:

- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **Naive Bayes**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## 📈 Performance

- **Highest Accuracy Achieved**: **93.06%**  
- **Best ROC AUC Score**: **0.9548**  
  These results demonstrate strong model performance and excellent ability to distinguish between classes (cancer vs. no cancer).

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall & F1-score  
- ROC AUC Curve  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Cross-validation for performance consistency

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries

- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Incorporate deep learning models (e.g., CNN with image data if available)  
- Deployment as a web-based diagnostic tool
